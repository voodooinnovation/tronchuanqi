Extended IEParser V2

1) IEParser now handles Frames !!!!

- 3 new events have been added : onframset, onframe, and onNoframe.
- the OnFrame event returns the URL of the corresponding frame. Hence it is possible
to reuse IEParser to parse the frames.
- a boolean property has been added to ask the parsing of the NOFRAMES section. Just set it to true
and the section will be parsed like the rest of the file. Use the OnNoframes event to know if some event
is happening in the main section or in the noframes section.

2) BugCorrection : with extended IEParser V1, when a string was being parsed and when the url was relative
(href or src), the corresponding url was preceeded with the string 'about:blanc'.


Extended IEParser V1

1) IEParser will not open an extrawindow if scripts are prohibited
2) It is now possible to parse a given html string instead of having 
to get the url on the web
- to control this I added a new 'html' property to the component. if 
the 'URL' property contains a string the parser will get the document 
on internet, otherways it will parse the document passed in the 'html 
property'
3) Like in TEmbeddedWebbrowser, the Download control parameters are 
now accessible from the object inspector.


for the rest , the component is as easy to play with than the original ieparser

Hope you will enjoy the extensions

sincerely, Marc Hervais
